	ADF Logging
=========================================

1. ADF logging feature is a thin wrapper around java.util.Logging API.
2. Fusion Middleware components create diagnostic log files in Oracle Diagnostic Logging (ODL) format.
3. Log file name and content format are as per Oracle standard.
4. Like any other logger, multiple levels of logging are supported.
5. Logging configuration can be done prior to or while running the application.

6. You can view and analyze the logs using Oracle Diagnostic Log (ODL) analyzer.
7. Logging config is done by modifying logging.xml using overview editor of ODL configuration.
8. Opening ODL overview editor can be done using one of following steps.
	a. In App Server Navigator, RClick IntegratedWeblogicServer and choose configure oracle diag logging for server name.
	b. From log window action menu, select configure ODL.
